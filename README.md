## <a name="howToPlay"></a> Game Features & How to Play
First of all, get a friend to play against! Note, Connect 2^2 can only handle mouse input so keyboard input(s) won't do anything.

### Features
Title Screen: 
- "Play": Goes to the game screen to play the game.
- "Option": Goes to the option screen to pick a soundtrack, adjust BGM & SFX volume, or to read the game rules.
- "Quit": Exits the game. 

Option Screen: 
- "Select BGM": Selects a song from a selection of copyright-free music.
- "BGM Volume": Toggle BGM volume.
- "SFX Volume": Toggle SFX volume.
- Displays instructions on how to win the game. 

### How to Play
The game screen contains a 6 by 7 board, be the first to connect 2^2 discs to win the game. 
- Click on the circles on the board to drop a disc. 
- Click on the "Back" button to return to the menu. The board will be unaltered until the game ends or the user exits the game.
- **Note:** A disc will only be dropped on the board if a circle is clicked and if the top most row is unoccupied. 

The game ends if someone wins or if there is a tie, and proceeds to the end screen.

<!-- Elysia's addendum -->
- **Elysia Yong**

I created the Game class that brought the backend and frontend components of the game together, and I am responsible for most the GUI components of the game such as the different screens. I set up the main Game, Menu, State, and Button classes that are currently utilised for this version of the game. I also added other unused classes such as Handler and GameObject for future implementations whereby these two classes handle object animation in the game. I am also responsible for creating most of the graphical assets such as the game's background and logo, but the music and sound effect are from copyright-free producers and a friend. In this README, I added images in "Game Description" and "Screenshots" sections, and populated the "Game Features & How to Play" and "Notes & Credits" sections.
